= AWS EC2 flavor for Jenkins Evergreen

CAUTION: Work in progress

This directory contains the bits needed to create a flavor of Jenkins Evergreen which will be auto-configured when running in AWS.

It will configure Jenkins to provision EC2 VMs for agents.
The artifact management will be using S3, instead of sending back archives or Pipeline stashes to the master as usual.


== How to use it

The simplest way is to use link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[`aws` CLI].

=== Prerequisites

You will need to configure `aws` credentials to use the CLI.
Then, you will need to create or use a link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[EC2 Key Pair].

=== Getting started

If you want to follow the steps, create a keypair on AWS UI.
Then, download the `.pem` file under `.ssh` on your machine.

Then define the path to that `pem` file as follows by replacing the value:


[source,shell]
export KEYPAIR_NAME=<SOME KEYPAIR NAME DEFINED ON AWS UI>

Then, the following command should work without further customization.

[source,shell]
export PEM_FILE_LOCAL_PATH=~/.ssh/$KEYPAIR_NAME.pem
export PEM_NAME_IN_AWS=$KEYPAIR_NAME
export STACK_NAME=evergreen-test$RANDOM
aws cloudformation create-stack \
                   --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
                   --region us-east-1 \
                   --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
                   --template-body https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen/master/distribution/flavors/aws-ec2-cloud/CloudFormation/cloudformation-template.json \
                   --parameters \
                     ParameterKey=KeyNameParameter,ParameterValue=$PEM_NAME_IN_AWS \
                     ParameterKey=SSHLocation,ParameterValue=$( curl ident.me )/0 \
                     ParameterKey=PrivateKey,ParameterValue="$( cat $PEM_FILE_LOCAL_PATH )"

This will display a json output like the following:

[source,json,title=Jenkins Evergreen stack creation command output]
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:372953910679:stack/evergreen-test18717/269933c0-88b6-11e8-aac6-503aca4a58fd"
}

After a few minutes, the Jenkins master will have been created as an EC2 instance. To retrieve its IP, use the following command:

[source,shell]
aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --region us-east-1 --stack-name $STACK_NAME

This should display something like the following:

[source,json]
{
    "StackResourceSummaries": [
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "EC2EvergreenInstance",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "i-09acbba4df83bcc59",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2018-07-16T05:23:36.996Z",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
            "ResourceStatusReason": "Resource creation Initiated"
        },
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "EvergreenAgentSecurityGroup",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "evergreen-test17793-EvergreenAgentSecurityGroup-2538QM8PAIPN",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",

            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
        },
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "EvergreenMasterRole",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "evergreen-test17793-EvergreenMasterRole-120MK7UAUWEYO",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::IAM::Role",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2018-07-16T05:21:29.926Z",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
        },
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "EvergreenMasterSecurityGroup",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "evergreen-test17793-EvergreenMasterSecurityGroup-L2O7JE3F1LLR",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2018-07-16T05:21:21.057Z",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
        },
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "MasterInstanceProfile",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "evergreen-test17793-MasterInstanceProfile-9ZP9RP2YFF8",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2018-07-16T05:23:32.794Z",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
        },
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "S3BucketForArtifactManager",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "evergreen-test17793-s3bucketforartifactmanager-hwdtoaezhx1c",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2018-07-16T05:21:40.019Z",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
        }
    ]
}

For the `EC2EvergreenInstance`, if the creation is complete enough, there will be also a `PhysicalResourceId`, here `i-09acbba4df83bcc59` in the example above.

Use this to retrieve the instance IP address:

[source,shell]
aws ec2 describe-instances --region=us-east-1 --instance-ids <i-09acbba4df83bcc59> | \
jq -r '.Reservations[0].Instances[].PublicIpAddress'
1.2.3.4

TIP: `jq` is a nice tool to process JSON.
If you do not have it installed, either install it, or just look for `PublicIpAddress` field in the json returned from the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command.

Once you have the public IP, after a few minutes
footnote:[The master EC2 instance is being configured to run the Jenkins master. That is why even if the IP is already assigned, it could still take some more time to do additional things like installing Docker, pulling the evergreen image and have it started], open a browser on the http://1.2.3.4:8080 URL.
This should display the Jenkins Install Wizard, asking for a secret to unlock the screen, located under `/evergreen/data/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

To retrieve it, use the IP retrieved above in the following command:

[source,shell]
ssh -i $PEM_FILE_LOCAL_PATH ec2-user@$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS docker exec evergreen cat /evergreen/data/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Then, you will see the _Getting Started_ wizard, click on the right cross on the top right to skip installing additional plugins. Click _Start using Jenkins_.

Congrats, you can now use Jenkins.

NOTE: This documentation will be completed with fuller explanations on how to build and deploy projects once we finalize Jenkins Evergreen core developments.

== How does it work

NOTE: This part does not intend to explain every details.
This is aiming more at making it easy for users to quickly grasp what is going to be done, and what resources will be needed.

We use link:https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] to create the set of resources we need.

In short, the Jenkins Evergreen instance is going to run as a single EC2 VM, running in a custom _link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html[Instance Profile]_.

This Instance Profile is set up to be only allowed to:

* create EC2 VMs,
* and have access in read-write to a specific S3 bucket and only this one (FIXME: Not yet restricted => restrict to *this* bucket).
